Contained in this repository is the application1.py file, which is the application file. The database url is defined inside the file. The templates folder contains the html templates for the website. The books.csv file contains the books. the import.py file imports the books to the Heroku database. Requirements file includes required files. Create.sql contains the code that creates 3 tables: 1 for saving book information, 1 for saving user information (username and password), and 1 for saving reviews which links to the other two tables' primary keys.
I was having difficulty with setting up the environment. This caused a great delay and I was unable to finish the project. I was also having trouble connecting with my database. I will try to do better in the future.
